Deirdre Cruice Cabanel -- Portfolio 

# https://dmcc789.github.io/ 

For this assignment I have utilized the Bootstrap CSS Framework in order to create a mobile responsive portfolio site.  

In this assignment you will find a consistent nav bar, responsive layout, and responsive images across the 3 pages/files. 

All links are working and all pages are utilizing semantic HTML that was validated.  Utilizing the validation service allowed me to correct mistakes that I had made while trying to use semantic HTML within the Bootstrap grid system. 

During this assignment I practiced the habit of commiting updates more frequently as I completed portions of work. 

I have also included feedback that I recieved from my last assignment such as including the site link in my README file as well as adding screen shots of my final product and including comments in my CSS file.

I am interested in any feedback on my work on this assignment that could help me improve the site further.  Thank you!
