# Deirdre Cruice Cabanel -- Portfolio 

## Description 

In this portfolio web application I have utilized the Bootstrap CSS Framework in order to create a mobile responsive layout, consistent nav bar, and responsive images across the 3 pages.  

All pages are utilizing validated semantic HTML.  Utilizing the validation service allowed me to correct mistakes that I had made while trying to use semantic HTML within the Bootstrap grid system.
